<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since the FCC's controversial decision to adjust the spectrum allocation for intelligent transportation systems in November 2020, the need for targeted research has grown. There has been a wide range of changes implemented by the FCC with both the removal of 45MHz from existing spectrum allocations and the transition away from DSRC to C-V2X needing to be studied in greater detail. In this paper, we aim to explore the effects of these decisions by examining the potential impacts on commercial grade V2X hardware in a real-world complex radio environment. We will do this by characterizing both DSRC and C-V2X and comparing their performance to each other in several radio environments with different types of interference present. This will allow us to decide as to whether the rule change allows V2X to continues to provide for current and future ITS applications.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
  As cars make advances in sensing and computing systems the need for a dedicated communication standard has arisen due to the unique conditions faced by vehicles. In response to this need, the FCC allocated 75MHz of bandwidth for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This spectrum from 5.85 to 5.925MHz was to be used by ITS to enhance the operational safety of roadways in the United States. These rules dedicated this spectrum to Direct Short-Range Communication or DSRC a WLAN based V2X solution, they also created seven 10MHz channels for use by the technology within the band. This early reservation was intended to create an environment that would foster research and innovation in the industry-leading to widespread adoption of ITS.
</p>
<p>
  In the twenty years since the reservation, there has been limited investment in V2X. A 2019 report from the Congressional research service stated, that across the United States only 52 DSRC implementations are operational. This lack of adoption prompted the FCC to issue a rule change in 2020 reallocating the lower 45MHz the previously allocated band to unlicensed WiFi transmissions. In order to produce a single 160MHz block of dedicated spectrum for WiFi once combined with existing 5GHz allocations. This rule change also officially transitioned the remaining 30MHz of the band for C-V2X a cellular solution from 3GPP. The motivation for this change has been investments in the industry in supporting the technology. The FCC also stated that it expects C-V2X to provide more robust connectivity for ITS as opposed to DSRC.
</p>
<p>
  In this project, we aim to quantify the impact the rule change will have on the quality of communication achievable with both DSRC and C-V2X in the remaining band with adjacent unregulated transmissions. As well as examining the observable differences between DSRC and C-V2X connections. This will allow us to either support or refute the FCC's assertion that C-V2X presents the more robust solution and the decision to transition away from existing DSRC implementations is correct.
</p>
<p>
  To do this we will first create a system that can reliably and consistently produce unregulated interference in the band, given that no commercially available equipment is currently available for the band in the United States. We will then begin to test several commercial V2X solutions, both DSRC and C-V2X, made available to us through a partnership with the Utah Department of Transportation. Through a series of over-the-air (OTA) tests, we aim to quantify any observable differences between the technology both with and without introduced interference. This data will allow us to verify that the recent changes do not interfere with the band's original purpose of enhancing safety.

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
  V2X describes a family of communication standards two protocols are dominant implementations across the United States: direct short-range communication (DSRC) and cellular-V2X. These implementations control links physical and access layers defining how messages are composed and how and when they are transmitted by the radios. These protocols are important in ensuring operational consistency and interoperability across vendors and networks. This is similar to existing WiFi and LTE standards, which ensure equipment from one company will be compatible with any other piece of compliant equipment. Between these two technologies, the US Department of Transportation has 143 active and pending V2X projects across the country. These implementations service a variety of purposes in a multiple areas. For example, the Utah Department of transportation has a project which used V2X communications to monitor snow plows along the Wasatch front.
</p>

<h6>DSRC/802.11p</h6>
<p>
  The first major platform to exist for V2X in the United States was DSRC it is mentioned in the original FCC rule change that reserves 75MHz for its operation <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-allocates-spectrum-59-ghz-range-intelligent-transportation">[FCC]</a>. The individual standards are defined by 802.11p specifications put out by IEEE. DSRC makes use of orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing (OFDM) for control of the physical layer. This separates the data stream into several narrowband channels improving performance by decreasing the impact of cross-talk and interference. Then DSRC uses carrier access to multiple access (CSMA) for the radio access control system. CSMA causes the transceiver to listen for traffic and wait for an opening before transmitting to avoid over the air collisions.
</p>
<p>
  Since DSRC has existed since the beginning of V2X, its adoption has been limited due to a major flaw limiting its performance. As stated by Naik et al. DSRC fails to remain robust in dense deployments <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723326">[Niak]</a>. This is because CSMA cannot adequately cope with the complex multi-path environments present on roadways as well as busy airwaves. Which either results in unrecoverable collisions due to DSRC's lack of receiver acknowledgments or a positive feedback loop that causes the back-off time to grow exponentially preventing any timely transmissions from taking place.
</p>

<h6>C-V2X</h6>
<p>
  C-V2X is a relatively new technology released by 3GPP and is designed to make use of existing cell infrastructure to enhance connectivity, when available. While C-V2X also makes use of OFDM modulation, it takes key features from cellular networks like quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) on wider 15MHz channels to increase operational robustness and performance <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723326">[Niak]</a>. Another enabling factor is C-V2X's use of a dual interface system with one traditional LTE interface connecting to LTE infrastructure enabling wider area links and a side-channel interface enabling direct WLAN connections between compatible hardware similar to DSRC. Together with the advanced modulation and multiple interfaces has spurred much faster adoption with some automakers like Toyota transitioning from DSRC to C-V2X in recent years.

    For our initial OTA testing and measurements of DSRC/C-V2X performance, an OTA test of the equipment in a controlled environment will allow us to establish baseline performance and interference levels. To do this we are proposing setting up the OBU and RSU as part of the POWDER platform at the University of Utah, while using a movable SDR as an interference source as shown in the figure to the left.

    As a proof of concept to ensure we can accurately capture and re-transmit a signal we captured an active 10MHz LTE link on the PhantomNet testbed, which would be analogous to a C-V2X link. Two of the nodes make use of srsLTE software, i.e., srsENB and srsUE, to create a custom LTE network to be recorded by the recorder node. The recorder node makes use of GNU Radio to capture 50M~Hz of the spectrum centered at the downlink frequency (2132.5MHz) of the LTE link. We captured the whole 50MHz surrounding the 10MHz signal to ensure we captured any transmission roll-off.
    </p>
    <p>
    We also placed the LTE link under a sustained load, while the capture was taking place, thus ensuring that the UE does not enter an idle state. To do this we made use of a iperf3 session to transfer data across the link (in a downlink direction) and record the bit-rate achieved. We also monitored the connection using the uhd_fft, which allows us to observe the power-levels at and around the transmission frequency. The figure to the left show the performance impact of interference played back at different frequencies relative to the LTE center frequency.
