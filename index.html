<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since the FCC's controversial decision to adjust the spectrum allocation for intelligent transportation systems in November 2020, the need for targeted research has grown. (There has been a wide range of changes implemented by the FCC and both the removal of 45MHz from existing spectrum allocations and the transition away from DSRC to C-V2X need to be studied in greater detail. In this paper, we aim to explore the effects of these decisions by examining the potential impacts on commercial grade V2X hardware in a real-world, complex radio environment. We will do this by characterizing both DSRC and C-V2X and comparing their performance to each other in several radio environments with different types of interference present. This will allow us to decide as to whether the rule change allows V2X to continues to provide for current and future ITS applications.</p>

<h4>Project Goal</h4>
<p>Complete thesis research project and publish results</p>
<hr>

<h4>Proposed Methods</h4>
<h6>How are we going to deal with the problem</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop testing methodology to generate consistant interference levels at 5.9GHz</li>
      <li>Setup and gather baseline information with commercial V2X hardware</li>
      <li>Make a conclusion as the impact of unregulated interference on V2X operations</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What resouces do we need to reach the goal</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>SDRs and various radio and compute equipment, provided by advisor through the POWDER platform</li>
      <li>Commercial DSRC and C-V2X equipment, aquiring through partners at UDOT</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What are the potential risks involved? Any mitigation/contingency plans?</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having others publish similar results before we can get paper out</li>
      <li>UDOT unable to provide C-V2X hardware, will just have to publish with DSRC results</li>
      <li>Not getting paper accepted into desired conference</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>How long does each method take?</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop proof of concept and ensure methodology: 1 - 3 Weeks</li>
      <li>Get access to and configure commercial equipment: 1 - 2 Weeks</li>
      <li>Conduct testing and gather performance data: 1 - 2 Weeks</li>
      <li>Analyze findings and write thesis paper: 1 - 2 Weeks</li>
    </ul>

    As a proof of concept to ensure we can accurately capture and re-transmit a signal we captured an active 10MHz LTE link on the PhantomNet testbed, which would be analogous to a C-V2X link. Two of the nodes make use of srsLTE software, i.e., srsENB and srsUE, to create a custom LTE network to be recorded by the recorder node. The recorder node makes use of GNU Radio to capture 50M~Hz of the spectrum centered at the downlink frequency (2132.5MHz) of the LTE link. We captured the whole 50MHz surrounding the 10MHz signal to ensure we captured any transmission roll-off.
    </p>
    <p>
    We also placed the LTE link under a sustained load, while the capture was taking place, thus ensuring that the UE does not enter an idle state. To do this we made use of a iperf3 session to transfer data across the link (in a downlink direction) and record the bit-rate achieved. We also monitored the connection using the uhd_fft, which allows us to observe the power-levels at and around the transmission frequency. The figure to the left show the performance impact of interference played back at different frequencies relative to the LTE center frequency.
