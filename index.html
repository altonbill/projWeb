<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since the FCC's controversial decision to adjust the spectrum allocation for intelligent transportation systems in November 2020, the need for targeted research has grown. (There has been a wide range of changes implemented by the FCC and both the removal of 45MHz from existing spectrum allocations and the transition away from DSRC to C-V2X need to be studied in greater detail. In this paper, we aim to explore the effects of these decisions by examining the potential impacts on commercial grade V2X hardware in a real-world, complex radio environment. We will do this by characterizing both DSRC and C-V2X and comparing their performance to each other in several radio environments with different types of interference present. This will allow us to decide as to whether the rule change allows V2X to continues to provide for current and future ITS applications.</p>

<h4>Proposed Methods</h4>
<h6>How are we going to deal with the problem</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built a client server setup for secure messaging across a network</li>
      <li>Used RSA key pairs for message security and authentication</li>
      <li>Used SHA1 and DES3 for hashing and encrypting messages</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What resouces do we need to reach the goal</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a custom implementation of Malloc</li>
      <li>Maximized speed and latency performance</li>
      <li>Outpaced average performance by 10%</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What are the potential risks involved? Any mitigation/contingency plans?</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built a tool that found optimal routes based on cost</li>
      <li>Handled multiple cost parameters like dollars or time</li>
      <li>Searched an imported list of weekly flights</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>How long does each method take?</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a networked game using both a client and server</li>
      <li>Ensured smooth operation with over a dozen concurrent clients</li>
      <li>Streamlined network performance to reduce latency in a multiplayer environment</li>
      <li>Produced a GUI for user interaction with game and integrated menus</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What is the job distribution plan for each team member?</h6>
