<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since the FCC's controversial decision to adjust the spectrum allocation for intelligent transportation systems in November 2020, the need for targeted research has grown. (There has been a wide range of changes implemented by the FCC and both the removal of 45MHz from existing spectrum allocations and the transition away from DSRC to C-V2X need to be studied in greater detail. In this paper, we aim to explore the effects of these decisions by examining the potential impacts on commercial grade V2X hardware in a real-world, complex radio environment. We will do this by characterizing both DSRC and C-V2X and comparing their performance to each other in several radio environments with different types of interference present. This will allow us to decide as to whether the rule change allows V2X to continues to provide for current and future ITS applications.</p>

<h4>Proposed Methods</h4>
<h6>How are we going to deal with the problem</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop testing methodology to generate consistant interference levels at 5.9GHz</li>
      <li>Setup and gather baseline information with commercial V2X hardware</li>
      <li>Make a conclusion as the impact of unregulated interference on V2X operations</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What resouces do we need to reach the goal</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>SDRs and various radio and compute equipment, provided by advisor through the POWDER platform</li>
      <li>Commercial DSRC and C-V2X equipment, aquiring through partners at UDOT</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What are the potential risks involved? Any mitigation/contingency plans?</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>UDOT unable to provide C-V2X hardware, will just have to publish with DSRC results</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>How long does each method take?</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop proof of concept and ensure methodology: 1 - 3 Weeks</li>
      <li>Get access to and configure commercial equipment: 1 - 2 Weeks</li>
      <li>Conduct testing and gather performance data: 1 - 2 Weeks</li>
      <li>Analyze findings and write thesis paper: 1 - 2 Weeks</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>What is the job distribution plan for each team member?</h6>

    <ul>
      <li>Thesis Student: Jacob Bills</li>
      <li>Thesis Advisor: Kobus Van der Merwe</li>
    </ul>
